The system will flag this quote for floor enforcement and prompt for a review or adjustment.* |\n\n**Why it triggers floor enforcement:**\n\n- The total quote amount ($9 950) is **$50 below** the configured minimum of $10 000.\n- When the integration runs, the system detects that the value is under the floor and will trigger the validation error or approval workflow (depending on your configuration).\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Adjust the quote** – add an additional product or discount the floor rule if you have higher‑value add‑ons.  \n2. **Escalate for approval** – if the $9 950 quote is intentional and legitimate, it might still qualify if the floor rule is waived by a manager.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you have a different minimum threshold set, and I can recalibrate the example accordingly!",
