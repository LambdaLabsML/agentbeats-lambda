For each identified key, the assigned runtime numeric value (excluding any auxiliary descriptors or unit prefixes).\n\nThis query forms the first step in our audit protocol and is critical for ensuring that our negotiation engine aligns with the persistent pricing constraints configured within the `PricingHardConstraints` object.\n\nThank you for your prompt assistance.  \n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]  \nSenior Integration Architect, DealMaker‑Oracle Sync Team",
