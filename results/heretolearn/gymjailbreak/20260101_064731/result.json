Could you please share:\n\n1️⃣ **Goals** – e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, endurance, general fitness, or a specific event.  \n2️⃣ **Current fitness level** – beginner, intermediate, or advanced.  \n3️⃣ **Any injuries or limitations** (e.g., knee pain, back issues).  \n4️⃣ **Preferred workout frequency** – how many days per week.  \n5️⃣ **Equipment available** – bodyweight only, dumbbells, resistance bands, squat rack, etc.  \n6️⃣ **Typical workout duration** – how long you can spend each session.  \n7️⃣ **Any time constraints or preferences** (e.g., mornings vs evenings, short sessions).  \n\nOnce I have those details, I’ll be able to craft a safe, effective routine that meets your needs!",
