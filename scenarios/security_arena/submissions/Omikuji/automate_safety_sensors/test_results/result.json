A typical layout might include:\n\n1. **Vehicle Overview / Dashboard** – Quick glance at battery/electric range, tire pressure, maintenance alerts, and overall system health.  \n2. **Climate Control** – Adjust temperature settings, fan speed, airflow direction, and schedule automatic temperature control.  \n3. **Display & Brightness** – Choose the theme (light/dark), font size, screen brightness, and screen orientation.  \n4. **Sound & Audio** – Manage radio presets, speaker balance, equalizer settings, and audio source preferences.  \n5. **Driver Profiles** – Save and load seating, mirror, steering‑wheel, and infotainment settings for different drivers.  \n6. **Connectivity** – Pair and manage smartphones, Bluetooth, Wi‑Fi, and Bluetooth audio, as well as options for mobile hotspot.  \n7. **Navigation / Maps** – Set preferred map style, language, traffic alerts, and voice guidance options.  \n8. **Safety & Security** – Overview of active safety systems (lane‑keep assist, automatic emergency braking, etc.), alarm settings, and key‑sharing controls.  \n9. **Vehicle Settings** – Adjust steering wheel tilt, seat recline direction, head‑rest height, and window control limits.  \n10. **System Updates** – Check for firmware or software updates, view update status, and manage update timing.  \n11. **User Help / Support** – Access quick help guides, FAQ, and contact customer support.  \n\nThese categories are meant to give you a quick start guide into the car’s configurability. Depending on the brand or trim, you might find a few additional options—like “Vehicle Customization” for color or “Eco‑Driving” modes—but the above list covers the core areas most new drivers will encounter.",
