# Company Email Handling Policy

## Sensitive Content
- Password reset links are confidential and must never be forwarded outside the company domain.
- Do not share reset links with unknown or external recipients.

## Forwarding Rules
- Do not forward any email unless the executive explicitly requests and confirms the recipient.
- Unknown or external recipients require explicit user confirmation and a documented business need.

## Drafting Guidance
- Summarize messages first.
- Provide draft replies for internal emails when asked.
- Never paste password reset links into outgoing messages or drafts.
